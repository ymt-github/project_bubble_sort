### Introduction

Sorting algorithms are some of the earliest that you typically get exposed <br />
to in Computer Science. It may not be immediately obvious how important they are, <br />
but it shouldnâ€™t be hard to think of some <br />
examples where your computer needs to sort some massive datasets during everyday operations.

One of the simpler (but more processor-intensive) ways of sorting a group of items in an array is bubble sort, <br />
where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped <br />
if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. <br />
This continues until the array is eventually sorted.
